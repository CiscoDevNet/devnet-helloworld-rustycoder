## Step 3. Get going with Git

GitHub is a great place to store your files. You probably used to store your code on your computer, but today it's all about storing and sharing your code in the cloud. Yes, it's scary and probably a litte embarassing to put your rusty coder hello world code in public, but go ahead and do it anyways. Yes you can erase it later. It will make you modern and it will be a great way to get help from the community and get help from my DevNet team, since we'll be able to see your code when you have questions.

You should use **git** locally on your machine and **GitHub** in the cloud.

* Go to [GitHub.com](http://github.com) to create an account. You can use your personal or work email address, as you will be able to combine them in your personal settings.
* Create a new repository called *hello-world*. Make it public. Initialize it with a README. Good job. :-)

Now, let's get set up on your machine.
* Install **git** locally on your machine from [git-scm.com](http://git-scm.com).
Go to your terminal to check it out.
* **ls /usr/local/bin** You should see git installed.
* **git help** shows you the commands.

* **cd /Users/username/Code** Go to your coding directory.
* **git clone http://github.com/githubusername/hello-world** This pulls down your new hello-world repo to your machine.
* **ls** You should see your new hello-world repo
* **more hello-world/README.md** There is your README.
* **mv hellodevnet.py hello-world** (or write a new hellodevnet.py file)
* **git add hellodevnet.py **
* **git commit -m "added hellodevnet.py"
Oh- Did you get an error? Yes, you got an error because you didn't tell git who you are. You can pull from any public GitHub repo anonymously, but to make a commit you need to tell them who you are.
* git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
* git config --global user.name "Your Name"
Now try again
* **git commit -m "added hellodevnet.py"
* **git push**
Now go take a look at your GitHub repo. You should see your **hellodevnet.py** file up there. Success!

### Learn more about GitHub

I just showed you how to share code between your local machine and your github account, but these tools are much more powerful than that. They allow for collaborative coding. You can learn more about GitHub by doing [GitHub's Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/). You will learn how to work with other coders by creating branches, making commits, and opening and merging pull requests.

#### Congratulations! You've Completed [Hello World for Rusty Coders!]
